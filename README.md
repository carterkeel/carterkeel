# Hi, I'm Carter

Welcome to my GitHub — this is my central hub for many of my projects, including configuration files, web applications, and my personal **[website](https://keel.me)**.

I enjoy creating thoughtful solutions across both creative and technical disciplines. This includes content creation projects such as my channel, **[Random But Cool](https://www.youtube.com/@RandomButCool)**, where I explore tools, workflows, and ideas in an approachable way. I’m always eager to learn new technologies and enjoy teaching others through my tech-focused videos.

My primary interests lie in **video production**, **IT**, and **cybersecurity**, and I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
